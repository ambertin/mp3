### Find information about the number of reboots, remakes, and sequels for each year

```{r}

remakes_reboots_sequels <- db %>%
  dbGetQuery(
    "SELECT kw.id, kw.keyword, t.title, t.production_year 
     FROM imdb.keyword kw
     JOIN movie_keyword mkw 
     ON kw.id = mkw.keyword_id
     JOIN title t
     ON t.id = mkw.movie_id
     WHERE kw.id IN (82, 1134, 20757) AND t.kind_id = 1;"
    
    # 82, 1134, and 20757 are the keyword id numbers that correspond to the      keywords remake, reboot, and sequel.
    
    #This query is optimized because we use the primary keys in the keyword      and title tables to join. When we use "where" to select the IDs from         title and keyword, SQL only has to look at 1 and 3 rows, respectively. On     movie keyword, keyword id is indexed, so we only have to look at 32 rows     when referencing that table! Therefore, this query is extremely fast.
